# 687 Homework 1: Implementation of 687-Gridworld

## Execution of Code
The code is written in Python 3. To run it, simply execute the file.
If you want to run only a specific part of it, you may flip the booleans in
the `main` block.

The purpose of the 3 booleans is as follows:
1. Execute code with Uniform Random Policy for 10,000 episodes
1. Execute code with Optimal Policy for 10,000 episodes
1. Execute code with Uniform Random Policy for 100,000 episodes, and also
calculate Pr(S19 = 21 | S8 = 18)

## Output
Standard O/P reports statistics like mean, standard deviation, max, min for
that specific execution.
